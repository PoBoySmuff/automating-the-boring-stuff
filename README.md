# automating-the-boring-stuff
This is my repository for working on Automating the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart.
My goal is to refamiliarize myself with programming concepts, starting with the basics.
I plan to complete at least one chapter a day until I finish the book. After, I will decide
whether to continue with Python, or to move onto C++, or web development.
